                <h2> Draw Note: Storing Text and Custom Drawings as Notes! </h2>
                <p>
                    As per namesake, Draw Note is a Full Stack application developed with Visual Studio and 
                    coded in C# that allows multiple 
                    users on their own computers to create notes made of images and text, and save them 
                    to a SQL database via queries! Having barely coded in C# nor SQL prior, I was working 
                    with a blank slate, needing to determine how to transmit information given in by the 
                    user into SQL databases, as well as all possible edge cases that a user could give 
                    to the application. To get a full sense of all the functionality allowed in this 
                    application, <a href="https://youtu.be/oNP--bx7L1k" target="_blank">view this video</a>, otherwise, 
                    a rough description of functionality is as so.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Draw Note allows for the creation of new users, a password forget feature, 
                    the ability to create new notes, save notes, open notes, edit notes, delete notes, 
                    upload images to notes, draw your own images, or even delete a user and all their notes. 
                    C# was used in handling all of the front-end display and inputs, image conversion from images to bytes, 
                    as well as the software that users could draw in. A SQL database was used for data 
                    storage, storing the images as bytes[], as well as saving all of the note text and 
                    user information. The largest challenge was definitely learning how to upload images 
                    to a SQL database!

                <p>
                    GameBot is an application that was programmed through Python, 
                    using the Discord library. The mindset behind designing this 
                    application was finding a fun way to entertain users in servers, 
                    such as me and my friends, all while getting some programming experience 
                    along the way. GameBot was one of my first personal applications designed after 
                    switching majors to Computer Science, so I used this programming time 
                    to learn more about the process of generating, developing, and releasing 
                    a software applicaton idea. Some of the games I've coded within GameBot 
                    include~ Guess my Number, Memorize the Number, Memorize the Word, and 
                    my personal favorite, Verbal Memory Game!

               <h2> BridgIt</h2>
               <p>
                Coded in Java as the final pair programming assignment for my Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 class,
                <a href="http://www.lutanho.net/play/bridgit.html" target="_blank"> BridgIt is a 2-player game </a>, where the objective 
                is to bridge your sides together (left and right if player 1 or top and bottom if player 2). This game 
                may seem like Tic Tac Toe at first, aiming to connect your sides together, however, by blocking your 
                opponent repeatedly, you may be allowing for them to win. Unlike any other game that my partner and I 
                coded for this class, in order to detect if a game has been won, we had to utilize an algorithm. As 
                many programmers know, there are two main algorithms, Breadth First Search and Depth First Search 
                when searching graphs, however, neither are the most effective when searching if there is a connection 
                between two nodes. This is why we used an algorithm known as Dijkstra's Algorithm, allowing for the 
                fastest search possible in the case of this game. Using this search method involved using queues, 
                deques, as well as work lists. Although this was by far the hardest assignment I have received up 
                to date in a computer science course, seeing the game function on my screen was most definitely 
                worth all the effort.

                <h2>FloodIt</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href= "https://unixpapa.com/floodit/" target="_blank"> Based off this web game, </a> 
                    FloodIt is a single-player game that was done as a pair programming 
                    assignment for my Fundamentals of Comp. Sci. 2 class, with this assignment coded in 
                    Java. Techniques used in FloodIt include while loops, for loops, methods, void 
                    methods, classes, abstract classes, and interfaces, as well as an image library. 
                    The goal of this game is to turn the entire board into one color, starting from 
                    the top left box. By clicking on another colored box that is next to the top left 
                    box, the starting box will turn the corresponding color, adding to the amount 
                    of boxes that have been "flooded" as to say. Next, you click on a box of a 
                    different color to .change all your boxes to, with the current boxes you 
                    have "absorbing" the ones next to them of the color clicked, increasing 
                    the amount of boxes that have been flooded. This game is challenging for 
                    the fact that the player only has a limited amount of turns that they can 
                    make, so they must plan their colors clicked wisely. Although this game 
                    may seem challenging at first, after a few tries, it turns out to be a lot of fun!

                    of Computer Science 1, pair programming aims to teach communication skills as well 
                    as what it is like to code in the real world. The basis of Fishy Game was using an 
                    image library alongside traditional java techniques such as classes and methods. 
                    The goal of fishy game is to become the biggest fish in the pond, done by eating 
                    fish smaller than yours. If you try to eat a fish that is bigger than yours, your 
                    fish will instead be eaten and you will have lost the game.

                <h2>MineSweeper</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://minesweeperonline.com/" target="_blank"> The game of Minesweeper </a> has been around 
                    since the 1990s, but when to asked to code it for my Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 
                    class (my first computer science class), I was a lost dog on how the game was coded. 
                    Being the last assignment of the course, I was required to code Minesweeper with a 
                    partner in a language that I had spent the entire semester coding in: 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Racket</a>. 
                    The specialty behind this language is that Racket was developed in house by 
                    Northeastern University, using it to evenly level all first-year students as 
                    practically no-one had used it before taking the first-year C.S class. 
                    Even though I only had a semesters worth of experience using this new language, I 
                    was able to successfully work with my partner through pandemic conditions in order 
                    to program the classic game.

                <h2> Help Reduce Waste With WALL-E</h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into college with almost no programming or designing experience, one of my first engineering
                    classes required me to step up to the plate, with the professor asking me to work with three of my
                    fellow classmates to engineer a display of sustainability to be shown off at the Boston Museum of Science
                    at the end of the semester. Using tools such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, RFID, and Arduino, and languages like C and
                    MATLAB, me and my group were able to create a game with a theme of WALL-E where users would aim to recycle
                    RFID scannable objects (cans, bottle, etc.) to make new objects. As the levels would progress, it became more and more difficult to
                    recycle, with the game increasing the difficulty so it would be virtually impossible to succeed towards the end. This design was on
                    purpose to teach the users of the exhibit that it was impossible to recycle all the time, and instead we should reuse
                    our waste. This exhibit not only scored my group and I an A, but was also a huge success at the Museum of Science,
                    teaching the visitors that reusing is a much better option than recycling for long term sustainability.

                <h2> Tic Tac Toe with Arduino!</h2>
                <p>
                    As everyone knows and loves, <a href="https://playtictactoe.org/" target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe</a> is 
                    traditonally played on paper or even nowadays through the internet. What if I told you 
                    there was a way to combine the in person experience of Tic Tac Toe all while using a computer? 
                    Thats right! Coded by yours truly, I was able to use sparkfun components and arduino code in 
                    order to program in Matlab and C an app which allows you to press physical buttons in order 
                    to display your turns on a computer. Although this assignment was by far the most difficult 
                    I had to complete for my Cornerstone of Engineering class, seeing the result of my work 
                    felt extremely rewarding, pushing me to take a Computer Science course, leading me to 
                    switch my major to Computer Science.

                <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://playtictactoe.org/"  target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe</a> is a 2-player game that everyone 
                    has known to love, but when asked to code and test, I found myself never wanting to 
                    play the game again. Being the final Matlab assignment of my intro to engineering class, 
                    Cornerstone of Engineering, we were assigned partners to work with, required to put our 
                    all into it when completing the assignment. Prior to this project, the only coding 
                    experience I had was through other class projects, so I was still a bit nervous when 
                    assigned to create a game in a newly learned coding language. Techniques used while 
                    coding this assignment include loops, functions, and graphs. When all was said and 
                    done, me and my partner vowed that we would never play a game of Tic Tac Toe with each other again.
